# UI Before & After Comparison

## 🎯 Problem Statement (Czech → English)
> "ještě to UI celé vylepši furt to není ono indálně dej na obrazovky věci co k sobě patří nechápu uplně co vidím na těch jednotlivých záložkách a jestli to funguje vylepši barvy někdy není po stisknutí text čitelný prostě to ještě vylepši a zmenši ten black box at je jasné co se děje co bude následovat a jak se to dělá a proč to tam je zamysli se nad tím pořádně a hodně to vylepši"

**Translation:**
"Further improve the entire UI, it's still not right. Ideally put things that belong together on screens. I don't fully understand what I see on individual tabs and if it's working. Improve colors - sometimes text is not readable after clicking. Just improve it more and shrink that black box so it's clear what's happening, what will follow, and how it's done and why it's there. Think about it carefully and improve it a lot."
